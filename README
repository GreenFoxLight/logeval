This is a simple interpreter for logical expressions

Usage:
    eval <symtab> [-e|--enumerate] [-l|--latex] [-d|--debug] [-f|--file formula-file]

The file "symtab" must contain a symbol table, with the following syntax:

<Symbol Number>: <1|0>
...

Expressions are concluded with an ';'

If you don't provide a formula-file, the program will run in interactive mode.

Passing --enumerate requires the --file option and will enumerate all possible
interpretations of the symbol table.

Passing --latex requires the --enumerate option and will change the output to latex code.

Passing --debug enables bison debug messages, which enables you to see what the parser is doing.

Use "help" to get a list of available commands.
